				<h3>Josh Olsen</h3>
				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>I am a frontend web developer from Akron Ohio, with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from The University of Akron. I love writing modern JavaScript and CSS to make user interfaces that are both user friendly and good looking. I’m also interested in robotics, AI, and automation. I learn quickly, and I’m not afraid to take a deep-dive to find what I need.</p>

				<p>I started programming when I was in high school, originally creating JS “userscripts” to modify the behaviour of web pages I used often. I learned primarily on my own through online tutorials and documentation, and eventually created my own simple 2D game. In college, I continued to  learn on my own alongside my classes in order to keep up with the changing landscape of web development. While I earned my degree, I feel that the most practical education has come from the numerous resources available online, courtesy of the many amazing developers who have taken the time to share their knowledge freely.</p>

				<p>These days, I’ve started giving back by helping new developers learn web development. I am one of the founding members and administrators of a developer community that creates modules for Foundry Virtual Tabletop, a leading application for playing tabletop RPGs online through a web browser. This community supports over 2,000 members developing both open-source and commercial content. My own modules have been used by thousands of gamers, and I have contributed to many others. Often, this is by guiding those developers on our Discord server; giving them the resources, advice, inspiration, and encouragement they need to create amazing projects of their own.</p>

				<p>I love programming, and I delight in seeing my own creations come to life. Even a simple algorithm with a command-line output can be exciting. I am also a perfectionist, always fine-tuning what I make until it’s just right. I believe in learning by doing, so I am always tinkering with new things, seeing how they work, and how I can make something interesting.</p>
