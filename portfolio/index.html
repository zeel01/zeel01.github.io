					<p>"Monster Blocks" is a module for Foundry Virtual Tabletop. It provides a character-sheet for the dnd5e system intended to faithfully replicate the appearance of NPC statblocks from D&D 5e books. This is accomplished through a combination of advanced CSS and text generation. Not only does the statblock look just like a book, it reads like it.</p>
					<p>Used by about 8% of Foundry VTT users, this sheet is popular due to its simplicity and familiarity, while still being a fully featured digital character sheet. Monster Blocks is fully editable and supports all the automation that the Foundry software allows for.</p>

					<p>"Deadlands" is a campaign settings for the SWADE game system. This is a conversion of the sourcebook into digital form for Foundry Virtual Tabletop. The chapters of the book were converted into entries in the digital "journal" of the software.</p>

					<p>These entries would normally be displayed in a plain gray window, however with the right application of CSS they could be made to resemble the books they came from.</p>
					<p>Additionally, the character-sheet for the SWADE system received a similar treatment, providing a thematic look and feel.</p>

					<p>This is one of my oldest projects, but I'm very proud if it. I originally created this simple 2D game in Java and submitted it as part of a scholorship application. Later, I re-wrote it using the HTML 5 canvas (a fairly new technology at the time). The gameplay is identical, and I used my own same hand-made pixel art graphics.</p>
					<p>Being so old, there are some issues... like being tied to the screens frame rate making the game far more difficult with a high-refresh rate screen. However, it still works quite well, and even supports touch - though I think it's a bit easier with a keyboard.</p>
